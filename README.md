# clojure-examples
A collection of potentially interesting Clojure code

Currently there's not much here, but I'll be fixing that soonâ„¢  

**Running the code**  
Open a REPL with `clj` or `lein repl` depending on your preference  
Load the example file with `(load-file "/example/example.clj")`  
Switch to the namespace with `(use 'example-ns)`  
Then call the function as `(example-function "some-argument")`
